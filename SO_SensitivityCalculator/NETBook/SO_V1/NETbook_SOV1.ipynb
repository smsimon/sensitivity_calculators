    "This Sensitivity Calculator module calculates the optimal $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{sat}$, $G$, $T_c$, as well as the total optical efficiency of the system $(\\eta_{system})$ and net array sensitivity (NET) given information on the optics elements, detector efficiency, atmosphere, etc. A structure, $\\it{SensStruct}$ containing these calculated results is another output of NETbook. Note that $P_{sat}$, $G$, and $T_c$ can alternatively be fixed as input rather than output. The original calculator was used to make and validate predictions for ACTPol and AdvACT. Types of studies done in the past include proposal writing, choosing filter bandpass targets, evaluating the importance of bath temperatures 100mK cf 300mK, evaluating mapping speed losses from new/different optical elements' configurations, and optimizing per-detector aperture size (feedhorn apertures) given the Lyot stop angular size. A chart outlining the inputs and outputs of NETbook is below: \n",

These values are then used to create a table showing the forecast of the instrument. See below."

First, we step through each optical element from the detectors up to the optical element we are considering to calculate the total transmission up to that point. Then, $\\eta_{to}$, the total loss from the CMB down to element n, is defined for the element by multiplying the calculated transmission up to that element by its emissivity. Finally, loading power is calculated for the element. A special procedure is specified to calculate the atmosphere's load. Some of the equations employed here to obtain the atmospheric loading power are discussed earlier in the section describing the function $\\bf{get}$_$\\bf{Tatm}$ (which is called here)."
