    "This Sensitivity Calculator module calculates the optimal $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{sat}$, $G$, $T_c$, as well as the total optical efficiency of the system $(\\eta_{system})$ and net array sensitivity (NET) given information on the optics elements, detector efficiency, atmosphere, etc. A structure, $\\it{SensStruct}$ containing these calculated results is another output of NETbook. Note that $P_{sat}$, $G$, and $T_c$ can alternatively be fixed as input rather than output. The original calculator was used to make and validate predictions for ACTPol and AdvACT. Types of studies done in the past include proposal writing, choosing filter bandpass targets, evaluating the importance of bath temperatures 100mK cf 300mK, evaluating mapping speed losses from new/different optical elements' configurations, and optimizing per-detector aperture size (feedhorn apertures) given the Lyot stop angular size. A chart outlining the inputs and outputs of NETbook is below: \n",

These values are then used to create a table showing the forecast of the instrument. See below."

Note that a different atmospheric model, $\\it{am}$ (website: https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am/), is used in POLARBEAR and Spider. The primary relevant difference between $\\it{am}$ and Pardo/ATM is how they model the atmospheric continuum. $\\it{am}$ uses a physical model that runs through calculations of the quantum cross sections for collisions of molecules in the atmosphere. ATM uses Raleigh-Jeans spectrum instead, which is a good estimate for ground-based experiments.

This method of calculating $T_{atm}$ to determine $\\eta_{atm}$ is just for now, however.

    "\n",
    "For the case when any of $\\it{filter}$, $\\nu$, and/or $\\Delta \\nu$ are set to $\\bf{None}$, a process is outlined for assigning values to them. With $\\it{filter}$ set to $\\bf{None}$, a simple tophat is used as our bandpass filter function, 'bp.' However, $\\it{filter}$ can be set to more realistic functions, in which case $\\nu$, $\\Delta\\nu$ and  'bp' are defined accordingly. Frequency values are in GHz. Note that the function 'bp' chooses the frequency range to report out. We will read in the atmosphere model from $\\it{atm}$_$\\it{act.sav}$, spline it to the same freq range, and then calculate its average to use in estimating the atmospheric absorption efficiency, $\\eta_{atm}$. (See $\\bf{get}$_$\\bf{Tatm}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "We go through each component in the optical path from the CMB down to the detectors, initializing as needed. The class $\\bf{OpticsElement}$ defined above is used here to establish each optical element. Components include the atmosphere, Mirrors 1 and 2, the window, IR 1-4, LP40, LP4K, lenses 1-3, the stop, LP1a, LP1b, and LPp1. One at a time, each optical element's information is appended to the array, \"opticsinfo.\" For now, the number and order of the optical elements is pre-established, but our intent is to make this easy to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the atmosphere, we must first call $\\bf{get}$_$\\bf{Tatm}$ in order to calculate $T_{atm}$. From $T_{atm}$, we solve for $T_{phys}$ and $\\eta_{atm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the array, \"opticsinfo,\" is filled, we call the functions $\\bf{pload}$ and $\\bf{Pow}$ to calculate loading power. We calculate total loading power, the loading power of the atmosphere alone as well as the atmosphere plus the CMB, and the loading power of just the optical elements in the telescope (minus the CMB and atmosphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can calculate the optimal numbers we want to know: saturation power, $P_{sat}$, thermal conductance to the bath, G, optimal TES critical temperature, $T_{c}$, total optical efficiency of the system, $\\eta_{system}$, and the net array sensitivity, NET. Noise equivalent power (NEP) as well as the conversion factor, $r$ that converts CMB temperature fluctuations in Kelvin at the input to Watts at the detectors, must also be calculated in order to solve for NET. The relevant equations are below:\n",

    "\n",
    "$T_{c} = (n+1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}T_{bath} \\approx \\frac{5}{3}T_{bath}$  (Optimal $T_{c}$ for $n \\approx 2.7$)\n",

First, we step through each optical element from the detectors up to the optical element we are considering to calculate the total transmission up to that point. Then, $\\eta_{to}$, the total loss from the CMB down to element n, is defined for the element by multiplying the calculated transmission up to that element by its emissivity. Finally, loading power is calculated for the element. A special procedure is specified to calculate the atmosphere's load.
